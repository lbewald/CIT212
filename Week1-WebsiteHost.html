 <h1> Lachlan Ewald</h1>
 <h2> Saturday is my favorite day of the week</h2>
 <p> I could not find a catchphrase that I thought would fit. But, since I am reading the Return of the King, I will use Theoden King's Speach. "Arise, arise, riders of Rohan!
Fell deeds awake, fire and slaughter!
Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered!
A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
Ride now, ride now, ride to Gondor!‚Äù</p>
